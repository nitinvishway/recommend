# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System

A web-based Movie Recommendation System built using **Python**, **Flask**, **Pandas**, and **Scikit-learn**. The application recommends similar movies based on genre similarity using **TF-IDF Vectorization** and **Cosine Similarity**.

## 📌 Project Overview

The Movie Recommendation System helps users discover movies similar to their selected movie. It uses a content-based recommendation approach by analyzing movie genres and calculating similarity scores between movies.

The project features a clean web interface built with Flask and can be deployed online using Render.

## 🧠 Recommendation Algorithm

This project uses **Content-Based Filtering**.

### Workflow

1. Load the movie dataset.
2. Extract movie genres.
3. Convert genres into TF-IDF vectors.
4. Compute cosine similarity between movies.
5. Recommend the top five most similar movies.
